      <h2>Introduction to Social Media</h2>
          <p>Social media is a digital platform that allows individuals and organizations to create, share, and interact with content in real time. It has revolutionized communication by enabling people to connect globally, exchange ideas, and build communities regardless of geographical boundaries. Through features like posting, commenting, and sharing, social media fosters engagement and collaboration among users. It also serves as a powerful tool for marketing, news distribution, education, and social activism. Despite its many benefits, social media presents challenges such as privacy concerns, the spread of misinformation, and potential impacts on mental health. Overall, social media continues to shape how society communicates and accesses information in the modern world.</p>

      <h2>Social Media Worldwide</h2>
          <p>Social media has become a global phenomenon, profoundly influencing communication, culture, and society worldwide. It connects billions of people across different countries, enabling instant sharing of information, ideas, and experiences regardless of geographical boundaries. Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, and WhatsApp are used by individuals, businesses, governments, and organizations to interact, promote products, spread news, and mobilize social movements.
              In many parts of the world, social media serves as a vital tool for education, entertainment, and political engagement. It has empowered marginalized voices and facilitated global awareness of social issues. However, the widespread use of social media also presents challenges such as misinformation, privacy concerns, and digital divides between regions with varying internet access.</p>

      <h2>Impact of Social Media During Calamities</h2>
      <p>Social media has changed the way families, social workers, and the government get important information, especially during calamities like natural disasters and the recent pandemic. Before, we mostly relied on traditional media like TV, radio, and newspapers for news. These sources were good but had some limits. Now, social media has become a faster and more helpful tool for sharing updates and staying connected.</p>
      <p>During disasters, families use social media to quickly find out what is happening and where help is available. They can see posts from neighbors, friends, and emergency services that give real-time updates. This helps families make better decisions to stay safe and find food, shelter, or medical aid. In the past, they had to wait for TV news or radio announcements, which might come later and not have enough details for their specific area.</p>
      <p>Social workers benefit a lot from social media as well. They use it to communicate with affected people and organize relief efforts more efficiently. They can spread important health tips or warnings instantly to large groups. During the pandemic, social workers used social media to share advice on safety measures like wearing masks and social distancing. This was different from the older way of doing things because they didn’t have to rely only on printed flyers or announcements on radio.</p>
      <p>For the government, social media has been a powerful tool to reach citizens quickly and directly. Governments can post official updates on social media platforms to inform the public about lockdowns, vaccination schedules, or emergency rules. This reaches people faster than waiting for a news broadcast. Also, governments can listen to what people are saying through social media, which helps them understand concerns and react better.</p>
